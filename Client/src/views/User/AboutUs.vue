          As we know, today our world is under the control of technology because of this reason the world
          are
          related each other. Our country is one part of the world but, we are too late according to this technology as
          compare as others western countries. Even if our country is not developed in this project, try to change the
          Manual office system of Kombolcha City Water Supply into computerized web based system using
          todayâ€™s technology.</p>

        <p class="">
          Kombolcha City Water Supply has many activities. Such as, Customer registration, Posting Job Vacancies ,
          Feedbacks are received on paper and not organized , Maintenance Request are not modern
          and keeping method is also poor, i.e. the document can be easily damaged because of
          its
          traditional way of storing method. So, the project try to reduce this problem and enable the office system to
          have
          very fast service to their customer by designing web based service management system for them.</p>

        <p class="">Then the regional state forwarded the plan to all bodies and sectors to take their part. Here, I
          want
          to
          notice that, the successes of GTP mean a proud and prestige for all citizens in front of the international
          communities. So every citizen and stakeholders should give their own contribution for its successes</p>
